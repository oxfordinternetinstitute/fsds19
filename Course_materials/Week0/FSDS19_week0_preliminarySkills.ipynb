    "Preliminary skills in Python for Social Data Science \n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats on your offer for our Social Data Science program! This program will be primarily quantitative in nature although you will definitely be exposed to a diverse set of research methodologies, all of which we hope you will find insightful and useful. In order to make the best use of your time here, we believe that having some basic experience with Python would be a considerable asset. In this course we will be using Python extensively. There are many other languages being used for data science. In time you may be exposed to some of them, at least in passing. Yet a strong comfort with Python will be key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching most of the skills that you will need to get started in the first term (Michaelmas Term, 2019). Then you can apply these in your option courses in Hilary Term 2020. Finally, you will be able to focus on specific skills to apply to a compelling research problem in the third term, Trinity Term 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook \n",
    "This notebook is a representation of the skills that you should be familiar with. We will be starting from almost-basics in the course but having this sense of what is in the basics should help. We will cover the material on this sheet in an optional workshop on Thursday, October 10, 2019 as a part of induction week. If you are confident in this material you might want to attend the parallel session on 'Developing a Research Question' instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is okay if you do not know everything on this sheet inside out before course starts, but these are topics that we will only explain briefly. The basics are pretty easy to grasp on their own through some independent study. This will give us considerably more time for the tricky parts of Python, particularly as found in ```pandas```, the Python library for scientific computing. Basically, we expect you to be able to open **this** notebook in Jupyter Lab on your own computer, run some commands, and understand some basic syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want resources for practicing these skills there are many introductory texts. For a patient and clear overview, we recommend (and teach from) [Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/). However, you might want to start with an even brisker treatment. For that we recommend having a look at the notebooks from Jake Van Der Plas' \"Whirlwind tour of Python\": https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython. The links to the appropriate pages of Whirlwind Tour are written in each section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Whirlwind tour URL is GitHub repository, much like the one for this course. In it are a number of short Python notebooks for the basic skills. You can actually just click on the files that end in ```.ipynb``` and read them in the browser. However, to make use of them to execute code you will have to open them on your own computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the GitHub library, the simplest possible way is to download the library by selecting the green \"Clone or Download\" button in the upper right header, and then \"Download Zip\". Once it's downloaded, unzip the archive, place it in an appropriate folder and then launch Jupyter Lab (which can be installed as a part of the Anaconda distribution for Scientific python). To install Jupyter Lab simply install Anaconda and then click on the Anaconda Navigator to launch it. Jupyter Lab will be the first option in the upper left corner. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: We will be using Python 3.7. Install this version, not the 2.7 version. If you are on Windows, please consider upgrading to Windows 10. You should be able to use the 64-bit version regardless, but Windows 10 makes it easier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "From Jupyter Lab you should be able to navigate to a folder containing the python notebooks (notice that Jupyter Lab's side bar is also a file navigator). For what it is worth, you do not have to 'clone' or even know much about GitHub if you simply want to just download and extract the files. Later, we will want to deepen your GitHub skills once you are more familiar with programming and servers. "

You can also store these variables in collections. Scalar data types are types that refer to specific characters or single numerical value.
